# TextMining

What is text mining?

Text mining, also known as text data mining, is the process of transforming unstructured text into a structured format to identify meaningful patterns and new insights.
By applying advanced analytical techniques, such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and other deep learning algorithms, companies are able to explore and
discover hidden relationships within their unstructured data.

The process of text mining comprises several activities that enable you to deduce information from unstructured text data. 
Before you can apply different text mining techniques, you must start with **text preprocessing**, which is the practice of cleaning and transforming 
text data into a usable format. This practice is a core aspect of natural language processing (NLP) and it usually involves the **use of techniques** such as 
1. language identification, 
2. tokenization, 
3. part-of-speech tagging, c
4. hunking, and 
5. syntax parsing to format data appropriately for analysis. 

When text preprocessing is complete, you can apply **text mining** algorithms to derive insights from the data. 

Some of these common text mining techniques include:
1. Information retrieval
2. Natural language processing (NLP)
3. Information extraction

Data mining: Data mining is the process of identifying patterns and extracting useful insights from big data sets. ext mining is essentially a sub-field of 
data mining as it focuses on bringing structure to unstructured data and analyzing it to generate novel insights.
